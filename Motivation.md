## Motivation for the class

- Recognizing the power of *abstraction*
- Overcoming **math anxiety**
- Becoming informed and enthusiastic **consumers** of math

## Biggest concern

- Accommodating different **learning styles**. As a student of math
  pedagogy, I have learned that the good news is that there are more
  ways to explain a *concept* than instructors or authors are ready to
  share. And a mentor often warned me that as instructors we teach as
  we have learned, not as we were taught.

- **Class size** is likely to be big, and I predict that I won't have much
  choice with respect to when I must teach online, and where we'll
  meet if classes are face to face. So *math games* that might work in
  **small groups** are likely to be difficult to coordinate.

## Elements

Part of the problem with set theory teaching resources is that they don't get at the formalist motivation: wanting to take the least on faith and base definitions on the most primitive concept possible.

Intervals admit graphic and written expressions. Is there a counterpart for domain sets that will
resonate with students? Would have to be for infinite sets.

Tasks:

- demystify Wallis proof in BGDM section 1.1
