### Incomplete grades

An exceptional request for an incomplete grade is most often granted
to students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary
circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an
incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will
agree on a due date for completion of coursework. The student must
submit an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the studentâ€™s academic advisor to the front office:

Code for full details:

### Assignments policy

All assignments are required for all students. Completing
all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must
be completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete
assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has
contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).
