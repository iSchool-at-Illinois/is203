# Course policies

### Attendance/Participation policy

The iSchool expects students to attend all classes except in cases of
emergency.  Student Code on Attendance:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/>

Enrollment in this course includes expectation of regular
attendance. If you find you must miss (or have missed) class, contact
the instructor as soon as possible. Students may miss one class
session with no penalty; thereafter, each unexcused absence will
result in your grade being lowered by one step (for example, an A-
will become a B+). Repeated tardiness or leaving sessions early may be
considered an unexcused absence unless alternate arrangements have
been made with the instructor.

### Class conduct policy

Students share some of the responsibility for fostering an inclusive
classroom. Students are expected to be respectful of others'
perspectives and lived experiences during class discussion. Students
are expected to demonstrate respect for the ideas and opinions of all
other members of the class at all times.
