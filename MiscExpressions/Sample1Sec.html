<h2 id="emergency-response-run-hide-fight">Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight</h2>
<p>Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or if someone is trying to hurt you – we have three options: Run, hide or fight.</p>
<h3 id="run">Run</h3>
<p>Leaving the area quickly is the best option if it is safe to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time now to learn the different ways to leave your building.</li>
<li>Leave personal items behind.</li>
<li>Assist those who need help, but consider whether doing so puts yourself at risk.</li>
<li>Alert authorities of the emergency when it is safe to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hide">Hide</h3>
<p>When you can’t or don’t want to run, take shelter indoors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take time now to learn different ways to seek shelter in your building.</li>
<li>If severe weather is imminent, go to the nearest indoor storm refuge area.</li>
<li>If someone is trying to hurt you and you can’t evacuate, get to a place where you can’t be seen, lock or barricade your area, silence your phone, don’t make any noise and don’t come out until you receive an Illini-Alert indicating it is safe to do so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fight">Fight</h3>
<p>As a last resort, you may need to fight to increase your chances of survival.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think about what kind of common items are in your area which you can use to defend yourself.</li>
<li>Team up with others to fight if the situation allows.</li>
<li>Mentally prepare yourself – you may be in a fight for your life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware of persons with disabilities who may need additional assistance in emergency situations.</p>
