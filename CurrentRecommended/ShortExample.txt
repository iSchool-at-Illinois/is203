# Academic Integrity

> *Provide information regarding academic integrity. The following is an example.*

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.

# Accessibility Statement
To obtain accessibility-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the [Disability Resources and Educational Services](http://disability.illinois.edu/) (DRES) as soon
as possible.  To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St.,
Champaign, call (217) 333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to
disability@illinois.edu.

# Assignments and Evaluation

> *This section should detail the grading policy (what constitutes an
> A, B, C, etc.) and also delineate the differences among variable
> credit assignments. Brief descriptions of assignments can be
> included here. Instructors who employ a points system should explain
> how these translate into letter grades. Information regarding what
> should be included with assignments (name, page numbers, cover
> sheets, etc.)  can also be included in this section.*

> *Include information about incomplete grades. Students must
> request an incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor and
> student will agree on a due date for completion of coursework and
> the student must file an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the
> instructor, and the student’s academic advisor with the School’s
> records representative. More information on incompletes is available
> here:*
> <http://webdocs.ischool.illinois.edu/registration/incomplete_grade_form.pdf>

> *Include a policy on late assignments. Describe requirements for
> attendance, participation, and etiquette. Note any requirements
> regarding excused absences. Consider linking to the student code,
> which states that "Regular class attendance is expected of all
> students at the University"*
> <http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part5_1-501.html>

## Sample Policy Text

All assignments are required for all students. Completing
all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must
be completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete
assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has
contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).



## Emergency response: Run, Hide, Fight

Emergencies can happen anywhere and at any time. It is important that
we take a minute to prepare for a situation in which our safety or
even our lives could depend on our ability to react quickly. When
we’re faced with any kind of emergency – like fire, severe weather or
if someone is trying to hurt you – The [University of Illinois Police
Department](http://police.illinois.edu/safe) recommends three options:
[Run, hide or
fight](http://police.illinois.edu/dpsapp/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/syllabus-attachment.pdf).
