** GenEd Requirements (written for a student audience)
*** TODO Course rubric, number, title, and number of credits (if differential credit, also indicate)
*** TODO The Instructor's name, office location, and contact information
*** TODO A brief description of the course, ideally one that expands on the catalog description
*** TODO Notation of any pre-requisites, as well as requirements course meets (Gen Ed, major/minor requirement, other)
*** TODO Notation of frequency and duration of class meetings (e.g., MWF 10:00-10:50 AM, TR 8:00-9:15 AM)

See http://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/courses/proposing-new-courses
as well as the LAS Course Proposal Form for more information on the
relationship between Credit Hours and Contact Hours
*** TODO A list of required and, if applicable, recommended course texts 

with complete information such as author(s), publisher, date of
publication, plus where to obtain texts (including any found online)
*** TODO A list of 3 or more Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs). 

For Gen Ed courses, consider keying to the specific Gen Ed
requirement; for courses in the major, to major program goals. For
more information about SLOs, see
https://provost.illinois.edu/assessment/learning-outcomes-assessment/what-is-learning-outcomes-assessment/#categories).
*** TODO A Course Calendar that includes course topics, daily readings and assignments, and due dates
*** TODO Course grading policies and breakdown of final grade 
(e.g., Papers 40%, Exams 40%, Group Presentation 20%); a brief
description of major assignments is also helpful to include
*** TODO A course attendance policy, including instructor’s policies on late work, makeup exams, etc.

- See http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part5_1-501.html

*** TODO A statement on Academic Integrity

- Example: According to the Student Code, `It is the responsibility of each student to refrain 
  from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead
  to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others
  in such infractions.’ Please know that it is my responsibility as an
  instructor to uphold the academic integrity policy of the
  University, which can be found here:
  http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html
*** TODO A statement for students who need disability accommodations 

(e.g., "To ensure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class are asked to see me as soon as
possible.")

** Quantitative Reasoning Requirements

*** Quantitative Reasoning I

Respond to the appropriate section below.

If the course is a mathematics course:

1. Show that the course is a either a calculus course, or a
   mathematics course for which calculus is a prerequisite, or a
   college-level mathematics course emphasizing logical thought
   processes as opposed to memorization or manipulation of
   mathematical formulas.

2. How does the course teach clear organization and exposition of
   mathematical thought?

If the course is a computer science course:

1. Show that the course involves problem formulation, algorithm
   development, and a significant amount of coding of programs.

2. What field of computer applications is addressed in the course?

If the course is a course in symbolic logic:

1. How does the course emphasize the algebra of symbolic and
   scientific reasoning, and introduce the techniques of formal
   logics, including truth-fundamental logic and quantification
   theory, methods for the valuation of scientific evidence, and the
   use of scientific information in decision making?

2. How does the course teach the student the translation of verbal
   arguments into their symbolic counterparts, the manipulation of
   symbols, and the translation of word problems into their symbolic
   representations?

If the course is a probability or statistics course:

1. How does the course emphasize the relationships between the
   assumptions of the probabilistic and statistical models discussed
   and the conclusions drawn?

2. What strategy is employed to assure that students will understand
   when particular models are appropriate or inappropriate?


*** Quantitative Reasoning II

The Quantitative Reasoning II requirement can be met by completing:
(1) a second course approved for Quantitative Reasoning I credit; (2)
a course in mathematics, statistics, computer science or symbolic
logic that builds upon and expands a prerequisite course taken to meet
the Quantitative Reasoning I requirement; or (3) a course in any
department at the 100, 200 or 300-level in which at least 25 percent
of the course material and graded material require the use of
mathematics, computer science, probability and statistics, or symbolic
logic consistent with Quantitative Reasoning I guidelines.

If the course incorporates mathematics:

If the course incorporates mathematics show how at least 25 percent of
the course content and graded material incorporates either calculus,
or mathematics for which calculus is a prerequisite, or college-level
mathematics emphasizing logical thought processes as opposed to
memorization or manipulation of mathematical formulas.

If the course incorporates computer science:

Show how at least 25 percent of the course content and graded material
incorporates problem formulation, algorithm development, and a
significant amount of coding of programs.


If the course incorporates symbolic logic:

Show how at least 25 percent of the course content and graded material
incorporates the algebra of symbolic and scientific reasoning, and
introduce the techniques of formal logics, including truth-fundamental
logic and quantification theory, methods for the valuation of
scientific evidence, and the use of scientific information in decision
making?


If the course incorporates probability or statistics:

Show how at least 25 percent of the course content and graded material
incorporates the relationships between the assumptions of the
probabilistic and statistical models discussed and the conclusions
drawn?
