# Strange to ask what math is 'about'

- Wallis, in section 1.1 of *BGDM*, says that all math "rests on the
  foundations of set theory and numbers."

- We're not given a definition for 'number,' but we're told numbers
  have properties (attributes or characteristics).

- Those attributes don't include visibility, since numbers aren't
  objects in space like the printed strings of numeric digits that
  represent numbers.

- The string '651' represents the number six hundred fifty one in base
  10, but four hundred twenty five in base 8.

- Numbers are abstract things; we can't see or touch them. So how
  exactly do we learn anything about them?

# Sets are abstract too

- Wallis defines a set as "any collection of objects, provided only
  that there is a well-defined rule, called the *membership law*, for
  determining whether a given object belongs to the set."

- We're told that a collection of tires or saucepans could constitute
  a set. Tires and saucepans are physical objects we can see and touch.

- But the set that physical objects belong to is not a physical object.

- Some philosophers consider sets to be ideas in our minds, but most
  mathematicians believe (or at least act like they believe) sets are
  abstract objects like numbers. They treat sets (and numbers) as if
  they were real objects outside of space and time.
