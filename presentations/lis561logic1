# Last week: propositional logic

- The propositional logic introduced last week used lower case letters to represent
  propositions: things that could be true or false.
- For example $r$ might stand for the proposition "Romeo loves Juliet," and $o$
  might stand for "Othello loves Iago."
- The proposition letters are joined by operators and parentheses according to the
  rules of a formal grammar to make logical expressions. For example, the
  expression $(r \wedge {\neg}o)$ would mean "Romeo loves Juliet, but Othello
  does not love Iago."
  
# Semantic of propositional logic

- Logic expressions also have truth values, but only with respect to particular
  truth value assignments to the proposition letters.
- We model states of affairs two ways: first as a group of proposition letters with
  truth values assigned to them. For example, there are four possible states of affairs
  for the two propositions $r$ and $o$.
- The second way of understanding states of affairs is as valuations: functions from
  expressions to truth values. For example, there is only one of the four states of
  affairs that maps the expression $(r \wedge {\neg}o)$ to \textit{true}. That is to
  say, only one of those states of affairs models that expression.
  
# Predicate logic expressions

- Predicate logic (also called first order logic) uses the same parentheses and
  operators as propositional logic. But letters are used in three different ways.
- Lower case letters from the beginning of the Latin alphabet represent specific
  individual things in the domain we're modeling. Think of them like proper names.
- Lower case letters from the end of the alphabet (like $x$ and $y$) are variables
  that can denote different individuals under different assignments---just like 
  variables in algebraic expressions.  
- Capital letters represent properties that an individual might have, classes they
  might belong to, or relations they might stand in. Think of them like relations in
  a relational database.
- Finally we have two new \textit{quantifiers}: the symbol $\forall$ is read "for all"
  and $\exists$ is read "there exists."
  
# Examples of predicate logic expressions

- Predicates take a particular number of arguments, and the order matters. Let $Lxy$
  stand for the binary predicate "x loves y," $Vx$ stand for the unary predicate
  "x is a lover," and the propositional constants $r, j, o, d, i$ stand for Romeo,
  Juliet, Othello, Desdemona, and Iago, respectively.
- $Lrj$ means "Romeo loves Juliet."
- $(Lrj \wedge {\neg}Loi)$ means "Romeo loves Juliet, but Othello doesn't love Iago."
- ${\forall}x Lxd$ means "everyone loves Desdemona"
- ${\neg\exists}xLix$ means "Iago loves no one."
- ${\forall}x {\forall}y (Vx \rightarrow Lyx)$ means "everyone loves a lover."
- ${\forall}x (Vx \leftrightarrow {\exists}z Lxz)$ means "a lover is someone who loves."

# Predicates are like relations

- Imagine a sales application domain where items are sold to customers at particular times for particular prices.
- We stipulate a set of persons $P$, a set of items $I$, a set of times $T$, and $\mathcal{Z}$, the integers that we'll
  use for expressing prices in $0.01$ fractions of a dollar.
- Our domain model for sales is therefore $S \subseteq P \times J \times P \times T \times \mathcal{Z}$.
- Tuples $\langle p,j,q,t,z \rangle \in S$ are read as person $p$ sells item $j$ to person $q$ at time $t$ for $z$ cents.
- A relational database schema would be similar to our domain model, except that the attribute domains would be subsets of
  the database domain of constant \emph{values}, instead of being subsets of our application domain.
- In predicate logic, $S$ would be a predicate symbol instead of a relation symbol. And we would use letters near the start of the
  alphabet for individual constants and letters near the end of the alphabet for variables.

# Predicates need not be binary

- We might express constraints like "Buyers and sellers are persons, and no one sells to himself" with an expression like
  ${\forall}vwxyz (Svwxyz \rightarrow ((Pv \wedge Px) \wedge {\neg}Ivx)$, where $Px$ is read "x is a person," and $Ixy$ is
  read "x is identical to y."
- Your reading allows infix notation for binary mathematical operators like $=$ for equality and $<$ for "less than," but
  having a prefix notation predicate symbol for strict identity simplifies our grammar, and allows us to distinguish numerical
  equality from strict identity.
- We could also express the non-identity part of the constraint as ${\forall}wxyz\ {\neg}Sxwxyz$.

# Quantifiers have scope

- The scope of a quantifier consists of the logical expression immediately following it. This means that one quantifier can be
  within the scope of another.
- Define $Cx$, $Px$, and $Rxy$ as meaning $x$ is a child, $x$ is a pony, and $x$ rode $y$, respectively.
- The ambiguous English sentence, "Every child was riding a pony" expresses two different propositions.
- We can express the first in logical form as ${\exists}x (Px \wedge {\forall}y (Cy \rightarrow Ryx))$. On this
  interpretation, there is some particular pony (or ponies) that every child rode.
- We can express the second as ${\forall}y (Cy \rightarrow  {\exists}x (Px \wedge Ryx))$. On this interpretation,
  every child was riding some pony, but no particular pony was necessarily ridden by every child.

# Existential quantifiers in the scope of universal quantifiers act like functions

- Our normal form reduction of ${\exists}x (Px \wedge {\forall}y (Cy \rightarrow Ryx))$ would replace the existentially
  quantified variable $x$ with a constant $f_1$ (even though it may denote more than one pony) because $x$ is in the scope
  of no universally quantified variable: $(Pf_1 \wedge {\forall}y ({\neg}Cy \vee Ryf_1))$.
- But the normal form reduction of ${\forall}y (Cy \rightarrow  {\exists}x (Px \wedge Ryx))$ would replace $x$ with a
  function of $y$, because the existential quantifier falls within the universal quantifier's scope:
  ${\forall}y (Pf_2(y) \wedge ({\neg}Cy \vee Ryf_2(y)))$.
- The function $f_2(x)$ maps a domain of children to a range of ponies that each child rode.

# Translating to logical form

- Many English sentences admit more than one logical form. We say they
  are either syntactically or semantically \emph{ambiguous}.
- A syntactically ambiguous sentence has more than one parse. We'll
  have more to say about that in a few weeks, but one example is "I
  saw the man on the hill with the telescope."
- A semantically ambiguous parse has more than one interpretation, even
  with the same grammatical parse. Consider this argument from LeBlanc and Wisdom:
       - All fathers are parents;
       - All artists are dreamers;
       - Therefore, all fathers of artists are parents of artists and
         fathers of dreamers.
- Define the unary predicates $Ax$ and $Dx$ as "x is an artist" and "x
  is a dreamer," respectively.
- Define the binary predicates $Fxy$ and $Pxy$ as "x is the father of
  y" and "x is the parent of y," respectively.

# Translating to logical form

It seems natural to translate the argument this way:

- All fathers are parents: ${\forall}xy (Fxy \rightarrow Pxy)$
- All artists are dreamers: ${\forall}x (Ax \rightarrow Dx)$
- Therefore, all fathers of artists are parents of artists and
  fathers of dreamers:
  ${\forall}wx ((Fxw \wedge Aw) \rightarrow {\exists}yz ((Pxy \wedge Ay) \wedge (Fxz \wedge Dz)))$

. . .

That translation is not only natural, it also gives us a valid argument. But on reflection, a strict
reading of the first premise gives us this translation:

. . .

- All fathers are parents: ${\forall}xy (Fxy \rightarrow {\exists}z Pxz)$

. . .

In other words, "All fathers of anyone are parents of \emph{someone}. And the resulting
argument is \emph{not} valid.

# Inference and validity

- Just as with propositional logic, a conclusion follows validly from premises if it cannot be false
  when the premises are true.
- As with translation, our common sense and domain knowledge can set
  us up for surprises. Consider (courtesy of Prof. Smullyan) :
      - Everyone loves a lover;
      - Romeo loves Juliet;
      - Therefore, Othello loves Iago.

# Surprised?

- Everyone loves a lover
      - ${\forall}x {\forall}y (Vx \rightarrow Lyx)$
      - ${\forall}x (Vx \leftrightarrow {\exists}z Lxz)$
- Romeo loves Juliet
      - $Lrj$
- Therefore, Othello loves Iago.
      - $Loi$

# Formal grammar for first order logic

From your reading for this week:

- $\textbf{v} \Coloneqq x|y|z|\ldots$
- $\textbf{c} \Coloneqq a|b|c|\ldots$
- $\textbf{t} \Coloneqq \textbf{v}|\textbf{c}$
- $\textbf{P} \Coloneqq P|Q|R|\ldots$
- $\textbf{Atom} \Coloneqq \textbf{Pt}_{1}\ldots\textbf{t}_{n}$ where $n$ is the arity of \textbf{P}
- $\varphi \Coloneqq \textbf{Atom}|\neg\varphi|(\varphi \wedge \varphi)|(\varphi \vee \varphi)|(\varphi \rightarrow \varphi)|(\varphi \leftrightarrow \varphi)|{\forall}\textbf{v} \varphi|{\exists}\textbf{v} \varphi$
