**Assignments and Methods of Assessment**

*This section should detail the grading policy (what constitutes an A,
B, C, etc.) and also delineate the differences among variable credit
assignments. *

*Exemplar language:*

1.  *All assignments are required for all students. Completing all
    assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade. *

2.  *All work must be completed in order to pass this class. Late or
    incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless the
    student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the
    assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).*

3.  *Late or incomplete assignments will not be given full credit unless
    the student has contacted the instructor prior to the due date of
    the assignment (or in the case of emergencies, as soon as
    practicable).*

4.  *Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not
    limited to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated
    in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt
    the work of others, provided that the following guidelines are
    followed:*

    a.  *Use of other people's material must not infringe the copyright
        of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing
        agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with
        respect to copyrighted material.*

    b.  *Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and
        author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment.
        Summarize the changes or adaptations that have been made. Make
        plain how much of the assignment represents original work.*

**Incomplete grades**

An exceptional request for an incomplete grade is most often granted to
students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary
circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an incomplete
grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will agree on a
due date for completion of coursework. The student must submit an
Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and the student's
academic advisor to the front office:
<https://uofi.app.box.com/v/ISIncompleteForm>

Please see the Student Code for full details:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3/part1/3-104/>

\[OPT\] *Exemplar language:*

1.  *Incomplete (temporarily excused) grades: Students must initiate an
    incomplete request by contacting the instructor. The instructor and
    student must agree on a due date for completion of coursework. The
    student must fill out the Incomplete Form and get it signed by the
    student, the instructor, and the student's academic advisor. *

**Grading Scale **

*Include the grading scale used in the course. If you permit A+ grades,
or have other measures for grading please include them here. Suggested
grading scale: *

94-100 = A

90-93 = A-

87-89 = B+

83-86 = B

80-82 = B-

77-79 = C+

73-76 = C

70-72 = C-

67-69 = D+

63-66 = D

60-62 = D-

59 and below = F

\[OPT\] **Course Policies**

*If the instructor has any strong concerns, policies or expectations,
include them here, i.e. readings must be done before the class meets,
tardiness is frowned upon, etc.*

**Attendance/ Participation Policy**

The iSchool expects students to attend all classes except in cases of
emergency.

Student Code on Attendance:
[[http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/]{.underline}](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/)

*Describe any other requirements for attendance, participation, class
conduct, etc. Note any requirements regarding excused absences, late
work, make-up exams, use of electronics, etc. Class
discussion/participation grades must be based on the quality of what was
said and how it added to the discussion, rather than the quantity of the
participation by a student. Class discussion/participation should
evaluate actual participation and not mere attendance. For a graduate
level course, attendance is expected, and should not be counted toward
the final grade.*

*Example attendance policies:*

1.  *If you have an emergency, communicate with the instructor as early
    as possible to prevent negatively impacting your grade. Students
    missing more than one class---or who regularly arrive late or leave
    early---will not pass the class unless alternate arrangements are
    made.*

2.  *Enrollment in this course includes expectation of regular
    attendance. If you find you must miss (or have missed) class,
    contact the instructor as soon as possible. Students\
    may miss one class session with no penalty; thereafter, each
    unexcused absence will result in your grade being lowered by one
    step (for example, an A- will become a B+). Repeated tardiness or
    leaving sessions early may be considered an unexcused absence unless
    alternate arrangements have been made with the instructor.*

\[OPT\] *Example class conduct language:*

1.  *Students share some of the responsibility for fostering an
    inclusive classroom. Students are expected to be respectful of
    others\' perspectives and lived experiences during class
    discussion.*

2.  *Students are expected to demonstrate respect for the ideas and
    opinions of all other members of the class at all times. Failure to
    observe this course requirement can result in a failing course
    participation grade, and may result in a failing grade for the
    course.*

**Academic Integrity**

The iSchool has the responsibility for maintaining academic integrity so
as to protect the quality of education and research in our school and to
protect those who depend on our integrity. Consequences of academic
integrity infractions may be serious, ranging from a written warning to
a failing grade for the course or dismissal from the University.

See the student code for academic integrity requirements:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/>

\[OPT\] *Example academic integrity statements: *

1.  *Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the
    University of Illinois,
    <http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html>, to
    which we subscribe. By turning in materials for review, you certify
    that all work presented is your own and has been done by you
    independently, or as a member of a designated group for group
    assignments. *

2.  *If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of
    another writer, proper acknowledgement must be given (using
    \_\_\_\_\_\_ style). Not to do so is to commit plagiarism, a form of
    academic dishonesty or plagarism. Please be aware that the
    consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
    will be severe. Students who violate university standards of
    academic integrity are subject to disciplinary action, including a
    reduced grade, failure in the course, and suspension or dismissal
    from the University.*

**Statement of Inclusion**

**\[OPT\] Land acknowledgement Statement**

*Adopted by the University of Illinois in 2018 *

More information:
<https://chancellor.illinois.edu/land_acknowledgement.html>

> *As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois at
> Urbana-Champaign has a responsibility to acknowledge the historical
> context in which it exists. In order to remind ourselves and our
> community, we will begin this event with the following statement. We
> are currently on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Peankashaw, Wea,
> Miami, Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe,
> and Chickasaw Nations. It is necessary for us to acknowledge these
> Native Nations and for us to work with them as we move forward as an
> institution. Over the next 150 years, we will be a vibrant community
> inclusive of all our differences, with Native peoples at the core of
> our efforts.*
>
> *Land Acknowledgement Statement Suggested by Native American House:\
> I/We would like to begin today by recognizing and acknowledging that
> we are on the lands of the Peoria, Kaskaskia, Piankashaw, Wea, Miami,
> Mascoutin, Odawa, Sauk, Mesquaki, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, and
> Chickasaw Nations. These lands were the traditional territory of these
> Native Nations prior to their forced removal; these lands continue to
> carry the stories of these Nations and their struggles for survival
> and identity.\
> As a land-grant institution, the University of Illinois has a
> particular responsibility to acknowledge the peoples of these lands,
> as well as the histories of dispossession that have allowed for the
> growth of this institution for the past 150 years. We are also
> obligated to reflect on and actively address these histories and the
> role that this university has played in shaping them. This
> acknowledgement and the centering of Native peoples is a start as we
> move forward for the next 150 years.*
