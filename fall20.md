# Course Description

A survey of mathematical topics for students in information
sciences. Provides an introduction to sets, relations, graphs,
grammars, probability, and propositional and predicate logic. These
topics relate to applications in information modeling, representation
and expression.

## Pre- and Co-requisites

None.


# Course Overview

## Learning Objectives

1. Introduce mathematical structures and methods essential for understanding
   information systems.

2. Prepare students for further core and elective undergraduate
   coursework in information sciences.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the definitions and uses of discrete and finite
   mathematical structures that are employed in information systems
   analysis, planning, and design.

2. Solve elemenary problems involving sets, relations, graphs, and
   other structures.

3. Recognize and appreciate the roles played by mathematical objects in models
   of application domains.

## Support of broader goals and objectives

This course advances the following broader learning objectives and goals:

- Degree program: Understand fundamental mathematical and programming
  tools for solving problems of information modeling, expression, and
  transformation

- School: Maintain global leadership in education for the information
  professions

- Campus: Intellectual Reasoning and Knowledge

# About your instructor

David Dubin is a Teaching Associate Professor at the University of
Illinois School of Information Sciences. He has over twenty five years
of teaching experience in the areas of information modeling,
information systems analysis and design, and the foundations of
information representation and encoding.








# Assignments and Evaluation

- Homework assignments completed individually (30%)
- Quizzes completed in class (48%)
- Analysis reports prepared in small groups (15%)
- Instructor assessment of participation and attendance (7%)

### Incomplete grades

An exceptional request for an incomplete grade is most often granted
to students encountering a medical emergency or other extraordinary
circumstances beyond their control. Students must request an
incomplete grade from the instructor. The instructor and student will
agree on a due date for completion of coursework. The student must
submit an Incomplete Form signed by the student, the instructor, and
the student’s academic advisor to the front office:
<https://uofi.app.box.com/v/ISIncompleteForm> Please see the Student
Code for full details:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article3/part1/3-104/>

### Assignments policy

All assignments are required for all students. Completing
all assignments is not a guarantee of a passing grade.  All work must
be completed in order to pass this class. Late or incomplete
assignments will not be given full credit unless the student has
contacted the instructor prior to the due date of the assignment (or
in the case of emergencies, as soon as practicable).

### Grading Scale

| 94-100 = A
| 90-93 = A-
| 87-89 = B+
| 83-86 = B
| 80-82 = B-
| 77-79 = C+
| 73-76 = C
| 70-72 = C-
| 67-69 = D+
| 63-66 = D
| 60-62 = D-
| 59 and below = F


# Course policies

### Attendance/Participation policy

The iSchool expects students to attend all classes except in cases of
emergency.  Student Code on Attendance:
<http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part5/1-501/>

Enrollment in this course includes expectation of regular
attendance. If you find you must miss (or have missed) class, contact
the instructor as soon as possible. Students may miss one class
session with no penalty; thereafter, each unexcused absence will
result in your grade being lowered by one step (for example, an A-
will become a B+). Repeated tardiness or leaving sessions early may be
considered an unexcused absence unless alternate arrangements have
been made with the instructor.

### Class conduct policy

Students share some of the responsibility for fostering an inclusive
classroom. Students are expected to be respectful of others'
perspectives and lived experiences during class discussion. Students
are expected to demonstrate respect for the ideas and opinions of all
other members of the class at all times.

# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

# Statement of Inclusion

[Inclusive Illinois Committee Diversity Statement](http://www.inclusiveillinois.illinois.edu/supporting_docs/Inclusive%20Illinois%20Diversity%20Statement.pdf)

As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
